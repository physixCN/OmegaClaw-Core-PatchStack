"""
Test: a chat prompt is appended to history.metta as an s-expression record
that quotes our REQ-tag, together with the agent's skill-invocation response.

Notes on format: the new agent writes history as top-level s-exp records
`("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" (...skills...))`. The old `HUMAN_MESSAGE:` line
format is no longer emitted — we anchor on the REQ-tag the agent echoes
back in a skill argument.

Run:
    pytest test_memory_history.py -s
