"""
Test: agent invokes the (metta ...) skill on explicit request.

The metta skill executes a MeTTa s-expression inside the agent. We ask the
agent to evaluate a tiny self-chosen MeTTa expression and report the result;
we accept any (metta ...) call and a follow-up (send ...) that references
the result. Agent can pick whichever expression it wants — the goal is to
exercise the skill, not to grade MeTTa semantics.

Run:
    pytest test_skill_metta.py -s
